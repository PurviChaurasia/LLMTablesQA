            "summary": "The Miami Heat defeated the Charlotte Hornets , 112 - 99 , at Spectrum Center on Wednesday night . The Heat ( 38 - 40 ) came into Wednesday knowing that a win would vault them back to the coveted eighth seed in the Eastern Conference . Miami had a tall order in front of them , however , as the Hornets ( 36 - 43 ) owned a winning record at home and were fighting for that eighth spot in their own right , although from a less advantageous position than their visitors . As it turned out , it was the Heat that looked considerably more postseason - worthy , utilizing a big third quarter to pull away from the double - digit road win . The duo of Goran Dragic and James Johnson were spectacular while combining for 59 points , and Hassan Whiteside posted a huge double - double down low on a night in which Miami won the rebounding battle by a 40 - 36 margin . Dragic led the way with a game - high 33 points , which he supplemented with four assists , one rebound and two steals . Johnson tallied 26 points , four boards , three assists and two steals . Josh Richardson was next with 19 points , six rebounds , five assists and one block . Whiteside managed a 13 - point , 20 - rebound double - double that also included three blocks and one steal . Tyler Johnson led the way for the bench with 12 points , three assists and two rebounds . Nicolas Batum set the pace for Charlotte , supplying 24 points , seven assists , three rebounds , one steal and one block . Kemba Walker registered 18 points , five assists and two rebounds . Marvin Williams pitched in with a 15 - point , 12 - rebound double - double . Cody Zeller and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist each submitted eight - point efforts , while Frank Kaminsky led the second unit with 13 points , one rebound and one assist . The Heat next head to Toronto for a Friday night showdown with the Raptors , while the Hornets remain home to tangle with the Boston Celtics on Saturday evening ."

            "summary": "Suns point guard Eric Bledsoe is having by far the most productive season of his career so far , making this cold stretch he has been on over his last four games even more uncharacteristic . His performance Wednesday night was the worst of them all , with Bledsoe shooting just 3 - of - 15 while still managing to come up with 16 points thanks to some good free throw shooting . But this is starting to become a trend , as Bledsoe has shot 13 - of - 47 ( 28 percent ) from the field over his last four contests . Despite those horrific shooting numbers , Bledsoe has still managed to average 16 points per game over that stretch , but that is only because of his ability to get to the line . Bledsoe has shot 31 - of - 35 ( 89 percent ) from the charity stripe in those four games , effectively covering up how much the point guard has really struggled as of late .The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Phoenix Suns , 110 - 91 , on Wednesday at FedExForum . This was a wire - to - wire win for the Grizzlies ( 33 - 22 ) , as they have now won three straight games and six of their last seven . Mike Conley led the way for Memphis , shooting an impressive 4 - of - 5 from behind the arc and 7 - of - 10 from the field overall . Marc Gasol added 19 points , seven rebounds and three assists , and six total Grizzlies ended up scoring in double - figures . As a team , Memphis managed to do heavy damage from long range , shooting a hot 14 - of - 24 ( 58 percent ) from behind the arc . The victory did come , however , with a bit of recklessness , as the Grizzlies recorded 22 total turnovers on just 24 assists . For the Suns ( 16 - 37 ) , their struggles continued , as Wednesday 's loss was their third in a row and eighth in the last nine games . And this one was one of the more forgetful outings , as the team shot just 33 percent from the field and 22 percent from behind the arc . They also managed to play rather recklessly , recording just 13 assists to their 15 total turnovers . Devin Booker ended up leading the way with a team - high 20 points , while Eric Bledsoe had a disastrous night shooting from the field , going just 3 - of - 15 en route to scoring 16 points . Up next , the Grizzlies will look to keep rolling at home against the Warriors on Friday , while the Suns will look to turn things around Friday at home against the Bulls ."

            "summary": "The Chicago Bulls ( 29 - 26 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers ( 11 - 46 ) 126 - 115 at United Center on Sunday . Chicago entered the game riddled with injuries to two of their key players , Jimmy Butler ( knee ) and Nikola MIrotic ( appendectomy ) , and will remain without them for another 2 - 3 weeks . While the Bulls are a different team without Butler and Mirotic , they continue to run a similar offense , one that was able to handle one of the league 's worst teams in the Lakers . It was a nostalgic night for Kobe Bryant , as this marked his last game in Chicago , one that brought up multiple montages of the Michael Jordan-Kobe Bryant days . The Lakers hung with the Bulls in the first half , playing competitively and physically behind Julius Randle , who strung together another strong performance to the tune of 22 points and 12 rebounds on 10 - of - 19 shooting . Randle is averaging a double - double on the season now , and entered the game with just over 10 rebounds a game , but it was his shooting percentage that needed work , and he showed promise for the second half of the season after a tough matchup with Pau Gasol and Taj Gibson throughout the game . The Lakers put together a 18 - 4 scoring run midway through the fourth quarter , which pulled the game within five points , but Derrick Rose drained multiple clutch shots down the stretch which kept the Lakers out of reach . D'Angelo Russell got the start in favor of Lou Williams , a decision that we do not know is permanent yet , but it was Randle 's first start since December 12 .

Chicago entered the game riddled with injuries to two of their key players , Jimmy Butler ( knee ) and Nikola MIrotic ( appendectomy ) , and will remain without them for another 2 - 3 weeks . While the Bulls are a different team without Butler and Mirotic , they continue to run a similar offense , one that was able to handle one of the league 's worst teams in the Lakers . It was a nostalgic night for Kobe Bryant , as this marked his last game in Chicago , one that brought up multiple montages of the Michael Jordan-Kobe Bryant days . The Lakers hung with the Bulls in the first half , playing competitively and physically behind Julius Randle , who strung together another strong performance to the tune of 22 points and 12 rebounds on 10 - of - 19 shooting . Randle is averaging a double - double on the season now , and entered the game with just over 10 rebounds a game , but it was his shooting percentage that needed work , and he showed promise for the second half of the season after a tough matchup with Pau Gasol and Taj Gibson throughout the game . The Lakers put together a 18 - 4 scoring run midway through the fourth quarter , which pulled the game within five points , but Derrick Rose drained multiple clutch shots down the stretch which kept the Lakers out of reach . D'Angelo Russell got the start in favor of Lou Williams , a decision that we do not know is permanent yet , but it was Randle 's first start since December 12 . The rookie point guard totaled 15 points and six assists in 34 minutes , while Williams pitched in 11 points off the bench .

An ankle injury to Dennis Smith , Jr. , who was in the midst of a stellar effort that consisted of 21 points , five assists , two rebounds , two blocks and one steal , was pivotal , as it robbed Dallas of a key component of its offense .

Joel Embiid was a force down low , postig another massive double - double of 33 points and 17 rebounds in 38 minutes , while Ben Simmons had a terrific all - around performance with 22 points , eight rebounds , seven assists , four steals and two blocks . Lastly , Furkan Korkmaz , who started in Butler 's absence , scored 18 points for the second straight night .

            "summary": "On the second night of a home - and - home series the Phoenix Suns ( 2 - 1 ) defeated Portland Trail Blazers ( 1 - 2 ) for the second time in a row , proving that they have got the upper hand this season . This was a close game for three quarters with 18 lead changes . It was a one point game early in the fourth quarter but Phoenix ultimately showed more composure in order to come up with the 11 point victory after a 27 - 19 fourth quarter . Phoenix 's backcourt showed off a lot of firepower and all around sound play Saturday night as they led the way to a good win over Portland . Eric Bledsoe led all scorers with an impressive 33 points on 12 - 21 shooting , 7 - 11 free throws , along with six assists , three rebounds , four steals and two blocks , absolutely filling the stat sheet like a fantasy players dream . Meanwhile Brandon Knight chipped in 27 points on 10 - 19 shooting and 4 - 9 from distance . Knight also contributed five rebounds , five assists and two steals . The Suns ' big offseason pickup Tyson Chandler cleaned up the glass with nine defensive rebounds and two offensive . Markeiff Morris turned out good numbers in only 22 minutes , scoring 15 points and pulling down nine boards . As for Portland , only 19 points came from the bench on 7 - 21 shooting . The lack of production from Portland 's bench meant a lot of minutes and a lot of pressure for their starters and this will likely be the case all season unless they find some help . The Trail Blazers are still awaiting the return of Gerald Henderson who should provide an extra scoring touch . On the bright side Damian Lillard did his usual business scoring 23 points on 8 - 17 shooting , while adding eight assists and four rebounds . Lillard also had 5 turnovers .
