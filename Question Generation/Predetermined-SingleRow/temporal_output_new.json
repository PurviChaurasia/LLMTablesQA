                "summary": "The Memphis Grizzlies ( 42 - 36 ) left the Chicago Bulls ( 39 - 39 ) barely clinging to their playoff dreams , beating them 108 - 92 on Tuesday . Memphis is left jockeying with Portland for the fifth seed in the West , holding just a single - game lead after Tuesday 's win . Injuries to star center Marc Gasol and point guard Mario Chalmers have left the team , once slated as a Western Conference contender , decimated and struggling to close out the season . Veteran Zach Randolph took matters into his own hands on Tuesday , however , going for 27 points and 10 rebounds en route to the big win . All-Defense team guard Tony Allen , meanwhile , showed off his lockdown skills on the perimter by stealing the ball four times . The team forced 20 turnovers as a whole in what was a solid defensive outing . The Bulls , meanwhile , look as though they may miss the playoffs for the first time since 2007 - 8 . With four games remaining , including matchups against the Heat and Cavaliers , and a 3 game deficit to overcome , the Bulls may find themselves on the outside of the postseason looking in . Tuesday 's double - digit beatdown did not instill confidence for the squad , as turnovers and free - throw shooting both looked weak in Memphis . Hitting just 68 percent of shots from the line , the Bulls struggled mightily at the charity stripe . All-Star Jimmy Butler was reduced to a non - factor by veteran defensive specialist Tony Allen . Butler scored just five points on the night . The Bulls face a make - or - break matchup on Thursday in Miami . Memphis , meanwhile , will travel to take on Dallas on Friday ."

Nikola Vucevic recorded a double - double off the bench , totaling 18 points , 11 rebounds and three blocks . Marc Gasol was the hero , as he hit two free - throws to take the lead with 11 seconds left . Gasol finished the game with 25 points , three assists and five blocks .

The Magic led 84 - 71 with a little over three minutes left , but the Grizzlies ended the game on a 24 - 10 run to win by one . Strangely . the two teams combined for 114 points in the first and fourth quarters , while combining for just 75 points in the second and third quarters . Turnovers are what really hurt the Magic , as they committed 18 , while forcing just 10 from the Grizzlies . Orlando ( 7 - 12 ) has made some adjustments to their rotation and the results have been mixed thus far . Nikola Vucevic continues to thrive in his new role off the bench though , as he tallied 18 points , 11 rebounds and three blocks in the defeat .

Orlando plays again on Friday , as they face the Philadelphia 76ers on the road . Memphis ( 12 - 8 ) continues to play shorthanded and they wo n't allow that to slow them down . Marc Gasol proceeds to carry the load in the absence of Mike Conley and Chandler Parsons , as he led the team with 25 points , two rebounds , three assists and five blocks in the win . Andrew Harrison finished with 11 points , four rebounds and eight assists while filling - in for Conley . Troy Daniels was second on the team in scoring , dropping 19 points on 6 - of - 9 shooting off the bench . Jarell Martin also had a nice game off the bench , accruing six points and 10 rebounds .
