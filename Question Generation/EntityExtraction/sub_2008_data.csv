"Integrated Analyses of the Sites- and Mode-of-Action of the ToxA Virulence Determinant from the Fungal Wheat Pathogen, Pyrenophora Tritici-Repentis",08/15/2008,07/31/2012,424000,Continuing Grant,8090300,Direct For Biological Sciences,Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems,Michael Mishkind,"The plant disease, tanspot, caused by the pathogenic fungus, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is a destructive and economically significant disease of wheat, which exhibits characteristics that make it ideally suited for investigating properties of pathogen virulence and plant disease susceptibility. For example, the fungus produces multiple protein toxins each of which is required for its ability to cause disease depending on the genetic makeup of the host. Understanding how these toxins function should provide substantial insight into how pathogens cause disease and how plants become vulnerable to pathogens. This project will evaluate one of these toxins called Ptr ToxA and investigates how and where this protein interacts at the cellular level.  The experimental protocol is highly integrative and incorporates a diversity of approaches including biochemical, cytological, molecular, and genetical analyses designed to identify interacting plant partners. Such partners include host proteins that mediate its uptake, facilitate intracellular transport, and comprise the toxin's site-of-action.  Successful completion of the objectives promises to be transformative not only for its contribution to understanding the basic biology of pathogen virulence and mechanisms that govern host disease susceptibility, but also for understanding processes fundamentally important to plant biology including, receptor biology and function, intracellular protein transport and chloroplast structure and function.  The project will support training and outreach activities in several ways including: the implementation of a workshop in molecular plant-microbe interactions at Heritage University, a nondenominational private, accreted institution of higher education sited on the Yakama Indian Nation Reservation in Toppenish Washington; conducting an eleven-week internship program at Oregon State University hosting select Heritage University students; and direct training experiences in an area with broad implications to the plant sciences for a postdoctoral associate or a research assistant and graduate and undergraduate students.",07/27/2008,05/16/2010,,819011,Lynda,Ciuffetti,ciuffetL@science.oregonstate.edu,07/27/2008,,Principal Investigator,Oregon State University,Corvallis,973318507,5417374933,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,United States,Oregon,OR,0000099,Other Applications NEC,7656,Symbiosis Infection & Immunity,"['9179', '9183', 'BIOT']","['GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT', 'GENERAL FOUNDATIONS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY', 'BIOTECHNOLOGY']"

The ""material"" is really a solid state structure made up of microlenses which can track the angle of the sun by use of optical effects instead of the more cumbersome physical tracking systems used today in conventional concentrating solar power. Preliminary calculations look favorable. The task now is to begin validating the concept, by evaluating and implementing alternative ways of realizing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: From an engineering viewpoint, developing a new family of technology is a fundamental achievement of great merit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The primary benefit of this project, if successful, would be to rooftop solar power. Studies of rooftop solar power claim that the roofs in the US could supply about 60% of peak electricity demand, and about 25% of total 24-hour demand, assuming today?s 10-15% efficient solar cells. Multilayer or ""tandem"" solar cells have gotten to efficiencies in the 35-50% range, but are expensive to make and to install over large areas. Flexible thin film solar cells are much more affordable a key factor driving their deployment in the market but are struggling to get to 10% in the future. If this new type of technology leads to flexible, affordable easily-deployed sheets which double the electricity one can get from rooftops, the benefits could be enormous. At best, it could let us meet half the nation?s needs in a carbon-free manner, at a price that would support its actual deployment.

This is a large multi-wavelength project to understand the distribution of sizes, albedos, colors, shapes, and rotations of the current comet population in the Solar System, to investigate how comets have changed in the 4.6 billion years since their formation.  This is important, because comets are used to probe the thermo-physical conditions of the proto-planetary disk that led to the formation of the solar system.  Although this is a larger question than this survey can answer, SEPPCoN will address aspects related to the make-up of the nuclei themselves, including bulk strength, mass loss, fragmentation, albedos, colors, and axial ratios.  Good understanding requires observing a significant sample of the comet population, and this project starts by focusing on Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) with an initial sample of 100 JFC nuclei.  This is about 30% of the total known sample and is large enough for statistical rigor.  The study uses data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and from ground-based facilities on Mauna Kea, La Silla, La Palma, and Palomar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project employs undergraduates for the acquisition, reduction, and presentation of some of the datasets, providing them with a true research experience.

"Collaborative Research: Structure, Function and Evolution of Authigenic, Methane-Derived Carbonate Ecosystems",10/01/2008,09/30/2013,320961,Standard Grant,6040300,Directorate For Geosciences,Division Of Ocean Sciences,David Garrison,"Authigenic carbonate precipitation associated with methane seepage is typically mediated by anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). This microbial process produces massive amounts of carbonate rock, introducing habitat heterogeneity to continental margins and providing a major repository for methane-derived carbon released from the sea floor. This study will investigate the extent to which these carbonate substrates form a distinct ecosystem within the seep environment by characterizing associated microbial, foraminiferal, macrofaunal and megafaunal communities in a successional context. Surveys and sampling of carbonate will take place at 4 bathyal locations on the Costa Rica margin (730-1300 m) and at Hydrate Ridge North on the Oregon margin (590 m). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Location differences and associated water depth, oxygenation, seep megafauna and carbonate formation variation are expected to influence community composition. This study will characterize assemblages inhabiting carbonates subject to active, weak and no methane seepage, and conduct rock colonization and transplant experiments to address the following main hypotheses:(1) Under conditions of active seepage at the seafloor-water interface, authigenic carbonate functions as a distinct ecosystem fueled by AOM, with its own sources of (chemosynthetic) primary and secondary production; (2) Seep carbonate faunal communities undergo succession driven by methane supply and microbial activity; (3) Sessile seep carbonate assemblages include mainly microbial, protozoan and metazoan species that are taxonomically and evolutionarily distinct from the biota of surrounding seep sediments, but ecologically and evolutionarily related to deep-sea, hard-substrate and reducing faunas, including those from seeps, vents, coral mounds and whale bones. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single rocks will be split and sectioned for carbonate mineralogy and isotopic analysis, FISH-SIMS analyses of endogeneous microorganisms and their respective delta 13C signatures, faunal (protozoan and metazoan) taxonomic, lifestyle and position studies. Stable isotopic and lipid analyses of foraminifera and metazoan protoplasm, delta 18O and delta 13C signatures of foraminiferan tests and mollusk shells will be linked to microbial and carbonate signatures to assess trophic pathways and paleo proxies for methane release. Archaea and AOM are hypothesized as key to both. Defaunated carbonate substrates will be deployed at active and inactive sites for 1 year to examine early faunal succession and the role of external seepage. Rocks transplanted between inactive and active sites, with appropriate manipulation controls, will provide additional information about faunal reliance on seepage and persistence of AOM in the absence of seepage. Community comparisons will be drawn with seep sediments, other biotic substrates (mussels, clams, tubeworms) and with other deep-sea reducing and hardground systems (vents, whales, deep-water corals). Macrofaunal assemblages will be DNA and selected annelid and foraminiferan taxa will be targeted for phylogenetic analyses to assess evolutionary affinities with fauna from other hardground-reducing ecosystems (vents).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Benefits of this research to society include: (1) an understanding of seep carbonate ecosystems for improved marine resource management and more comprehensive assessments of seafloor biodiversity, carbon cycling, and adaptations to extreme environments; and (2) a model for successional changes in carbonate ecosystems and the use of their faunas as proxies to more accurately assess past methane release and paleoclimate change. Education and outreach will include local school presentations; web site development and interdisciplinary, hands-on, at-sea training of future scientists at undergraduate, graduate, and post-doc levels, including under-represented groups (women; first-generation university students from rural communities) recruited through SURF, STARS and REU programs.

Collaborative Research: Distributed Error Correction Strategies in Wireless Networks,09/01/2008,08/31/2013,155000,Standard Grant,5010000,Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr,Division of Computing and Communication Foundations,Phillip Regalia,"Networked wireless communications over multiple hops is rapidly emerging as the main architecture of future wireles systems, including multihop extensions of cellular and WiFi networks, mesh networks, and sensor networks. Common among these types of networks is that they are not completely unstructured (or ad hoc) networks, but traffic is routed and accumulated towards a common destination. Due to this characteristic property, these networks will be referred to as Networks with Traffic Accumulation, or NETAs. Traffic accumulation creates hot sposts or bottlenecks around the common destination because of the increased traffic load and interference. Despite the severity of the hot spot problem, there is a lack of efficient methods to cope with it. <br/><br/>This research addresses the hot spot issue in NETAs by developing new distributed error correction strategies tailored to two important subclasses- line networks and tree networks. In line networks, the investigators study fundamental properties and the design of distributed channel coding protocals using serially concatenated and protograph-based constructions to strengthen the error correction capability near the destination without sacrificing badwidth efficiency. In tree networks, several source nodes may wish to employ a common relay node to broadcast their information to multiple destination nodes which may have access to side information from ""overheard"" source messages. The investigators explore a novel approach where each source uses a distinctlow rate code for transmission to the relay, whereas the decoded messages are re-encoded using a high rate ""nested code"". In addition, interlayer issues are considered, in particular the joint design of efficient channel access and routing schemes together with the porposed coding schemes.",09/03/2008,09/03/2008,,830666,Joerg,Kliewer,jkliewer@njit.edu,09/03/2008,,Principal Investigator,New Mexico State University,Las Cruces,880038002,5756461590,Corner of Espina St. & Stewart,United States,New Mexico,NM,0000912,Computer Science,4096,COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH,"['9150', '9218', 'HPCC']","['EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES', 'BASIC RESEARCH & HUMAN RESORCS', 'HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING & COMM']"
CAREER:  A mechanistic understanding of sediment transport in mountain streams with applications in river restoration and science education,06/01/2009,05/31/2016,455000,Continuing Grant,6030109,Directorate For Geosciences,Division Of Earth Sciences,Thomas Torgersen," In mountainous drainage basins, steep channels (gradients of 3-20%) occupy the majority of the total channel length and influence the downstream delivery of sediment and water to metropolitan areas and hydropower facilities.  The volume and grain sizes of sediment supplied from these streams also impact the success of downstream river restoration projects.  Basin-scale sediment transport predictions are needed in restoration design to account for the effect of sediment supply on aquatic habitat, water quality, and channel stability. Most sediment transport equations are based on empirical fits to data measured at the reach-scale, do not include the mechanics of grain motion, and were developed for lower-gradient channels.  It is hypothesized that bedload transport equations for steep, rough streams need to include: 1) the range of turbulence and grain properties that control the initiation of grain motion, 2) the spatial variability in stresses and bedload transport rates on patches, and 3) the effect of temporal and spatial variations in sediment supply.  Flume experiments will be used to test this hypothesis, further elucidate the interaction between turbulence and bedload transport, and inform theoretical and empirical models that predict sediment flux at the reach scale.  Such models will be tested in local and international field locations and will transform predictions of landscape evolution and river restoration design by providing accurate and mechanistic estimates of sediment flux in steep streams.  The intellectual merit of this research is a fundamental and predictive understanding of the processes that control turbulence and sediment transport in steep streams. The framework of sediment transport and river restoration will be used to educate graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students on the importance of water resources and functioning stream ecosystems. Four education objectives are proposed: 1) a series of graduate student classes that develop critical thinking, scientific writing, and interdisciplinary team skills, 2) international research experience for undergraduate and graduate students, 3) programs to educate K-12 students on river processes, and 4) a new Women in Science Camp that encourages young women to enter careers in math, science, and engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;",06/01/2009,04/22/2013,,847799,Elowyn,Yager,eyager@uidaho.edu,06/01/2009,,Principal Investigator,Regents of the University of Idaho,MOSCOW,838449803,2088856651,875 PERIMETER DR MS 3020,United States,Idaho,ID,0000099,Other Applications NEC,"['1575', '1579', '7458']","['EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES', 'Hydrologic Sciences', 'Geomorphology & Land-use Dynam']","['0000', '1045', '1187', '9150', 'OTHR']","['UNASSIGNED', 'CAREER-Faculty Erly Career Dev', 'PECASE- eligible', 'EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES', 'OTHER RESEARCH OR EDUCATION']"

Interactive Ubiquitous Visualization of Construction Progress Monitoring with D4AR (4 Dimensional Augmented Reality) Models,08/01/2008,10/31/2010,340000,Standard Grant,7030000,Directorate For Engineering,"Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn",Konstantinos Triantis,"Systematic progress monitoring through rigorous identification, processing, and visualization of progress discrepancies between planned and actual performances, is a necessity for successful project management. It provides an early warning to project managers and allows them to diagnose performance problems and to take corrective actions in a timely manner to reduce the impacts of progress discrepancies. However, systematic implementation of progress monitoring has significant challenges because: 1) Current practice is time-consuming since it needs extensive data extraction; 2) Quality of the manually collected data maybe low and subjective; 3) Existing methods are also non-systematic; 4) Reports can be visually complex and thus not effectively represent multivariable progress information (i.e., schedule, cost, and performance) in a holistic manner nor intuitively reflect information pertaining to spatial aspects of the construction progress and their associated complexities; 5) Furthermore, current reporting methods increase the time required to describe and explain progress situation in coordination meetings and in turn could delay decision making. Thus, with current mechanism, it may be not be easy to understand the progress situation clearly and quickly. The proposed research will therefore focus on addressing these challenges through an interactive visualization of construction progress monitoring using 4 Dimensional Augmented Reality (D4AR) models. <br/><br/>In the proposed research, progress deviations (e.g., schedule, cost and performance) would be visualized through superimposition of planned models onto site photographs using different visualization techniques such as traffic light and weather metaphors, fish eye, and x-ray. Within the proposed framework, a project manager would be able to: 1) use the planned model as a baseline for progress monitoring; 2) collect progress data from site photographs during construction; 3) automatically analyze images and quantify built components; 4) automatically measure discrepancies between planned and built progress; and 5) visually represent progress deviations through superimposition of planned models with on-site photographs combining interactive visual imageries. In such an environment, project manager would be able to walk through or browse through a rich visual dataset of augmented progress photographs , analyze progress, make control decisions and effectively communicate with project participants. To achieve these objectives, the proposed research methodology will consist of a formal cycle of data collection, formalization, testing, validation, and refinement. This will involve integrating research, education and practice at every stage of the project. Through this integration, students will gain valuable experiences by having industry partners involved in the process. In order to reach educators, practitioners, researchers, and students who were not involved in the proposed activity, broad dissemination of the project results will be actively sought. Ultimately, in order to make the research truly successful, involvement from a diverse group of students and practitioners, in terms of economic, social, cultural, racial, and gender backgrounds, will be a priority.

COMPUGIRLS takes place at two sites, ASU and the Boys and Girls Club of the East Valley-Sacaton. Already, 40 girls have completed one-year of the program. This project expands the program to include another 60 students, their parents, ASU graduate students and in-service teachers, and peer mentors. COMPUGIRLS provides hands-on technology experiences that include internships, Advanced Placement credit, conference and community presentations, and parent workshops that will ultimately develop participants' techno-social analytic skills for real world problems.&lt;br/&gt;As part of their experience, students visit ASU. For many, this is the first time they have been on a college campus. Students participate in 6 multimedia courses: 1) social justice and the media, 2) SCRATCH, user-friendly computer programming, 3) modding SIMS, designing, modifying, and troubleshooting simplified simulations, 4) choice of 3-D, programming, and character design, 5) advanced choice of 3-D, programming, and character design, and 6) teamwork to create neighborhoods in Sim City using all skills learned. Participants' projects will be disseminated semi-annually through community ceremonies, web pages, and presentations.&lt;br/&gt;The project builds upon a pilot program (Summer 2007 to present) that accommodated 40 girls from under-resourced districts in the Phoenix metro area. The COMPUGIRLS program is a two-year curriculum using multimedia activities as a means of encouraging computational thinking. The project advances understanding of how to encourage girls (including girls from underrepresented groups) to pursue ICT fields. It builds upon established research and includes evaluation of the impact on participants' computational thinking, techno-social analytical skills, attitudes about and interest in pursuing further education and careers in ICT/STEM fields. The goals are:&lt;br/&gt;1) To use multimedia activities as a means of encouraging computational thinking; &lt;br/&gt;2) To enhance girls' techno-social analytical skills; and &lt;br/&gt;3) To provide the building blocks for Arizona girls from underrepresented groups to successfully traverse an ICT and/or any work force roadmap. &lt;br/&gt;The evaluation of the project consists of a mixed-methods approach (qualitative and quantitative), incorporating the use of survey instruments, student journals, focus groups, interviews, document review, observation and an intensive case study. A comparison/control group is incorporated into the pre- and post-test design to determine the extent the participants' skills, knowledge, attitudes and behaviors changed relative to where they would have been without participation in the project.",09/19/2008,12/23/2009,,833773,"['Kimberly', 'Elisabeth', 'Sethuraman', 'Gregory', 'Jenefer']","['Scott', 'Gee', 'Panchanathan', 'Aist', 'Husman']","['kascott3@asu.edu', 'elisabeth.hayes@asu.edu', 'panch@asu.edu', 'aist@iastate.edu', 'jhusman@uoregon.edu']","['09/19/2008', '09/19/2008', '09/19/2008', '09/19/2008', '09/19/2008']","[None, None, None, None, None]","['Principal Investigator', 'Co-Principal Investigator', 'Co-Principal Investigator', 'Co-Principal Investigator', 'Co-Principal Investigator']",Arizona State University,TEMPE,852813670,4809655479,660 S MILL AVENUE STE 204,United States,Arizona,AZ,0116000,Human Subjects,7227,ITEST-Inov Tech Exp Stu & Teac,"['9177', '9180', '9251', 'SMET']","['ELEMENTARY/SECONDARY EDUCATION', 'PUBLIC SCIENCE LITERACY EDUCATION', 'REU SUPP-Res Exp for Ugrd Supp', 'SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION']"
3-manifold geometry and topology,05/15/2008,04/30/2012,333162,Continuing Grant,3040000,Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien,Division Of Mathematical Sciences,Joanna Kania-Bartoszynska,"This project proposes several avenues of study relating the topology and geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The principal topics are the study of immersed surfaces in 3-manifolds, maps between hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The most ambitious aspect of the project involves the virtual Haken conjecture, which is equivalent to showing that hyperbolic 3-manifolds have a finite-sheeted cover which contains an embedded pi_1-injective surface. The PI would like to relate this to the virtual fibering conjecture of Thurston, which states that a hyperbolic 3-manifold has a finite-sheeted cover which fibers over the circle, and implies the virtual Haken conjecture. The PI would like to show that Haken 3-manifolds are homotopy equivalent to a compact CAT(0) cube complex. Next, the PI would like to show that fundamental groups of hyperbolic 3-manifolds are LERF. This would follow if Gromov-hyperbolic groups are residually finite, although this is believed to be false by many geometric group theorists. Following a program of Haglund and Wise, these conjectures would imply that a Haken hyperbolic manifold has fundamental group which virtually embeds in a right-angled reflection group. This in turn would imply that these manifolds virtually fiber by previous work of the PI. The PI also plans to investigate the volumes of hyperbolic Haken manifolds, and how various topological restrictions on the manifold give rise to lower bounds on volume. For example, the PI would like to understand the asymptotic behavior of the volumes of orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds with n cusps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical study of 3-dimensional spaces goes back to the work of Poincare. Because classical physics describes our universe to be a 3-dimensional space, the classification of 3-dimensional spaces is an important mathematical endeavor, since it may have ramifications for the global structure of our universe. Recently, this classification was spectacularly achieved by Perelman, using Hamilton's Ricci flow, who resolved Thurston's geometrization conjecture, and as a consequence the Poincare conjecture, which goes back 100 years. The geometrization conjecture implies that any finite 3-dimensional space has a canonical decomposition into geometric pieces, the most interesting of which are hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Mathematicians studying 3-manifolds are still sorting out the implications of Perelman's work and of the geometrization conjecture. This project will pursue various aspects of the ramifications of the geometrization conjecture. The principal and most ambitious project will study 2-dimensional objects inside of 3-dimensional spaces, especially the hyperbolic ones, which satisfy certain strong topological restrictions. Studying these 2-dimensional objects has implications for the global structure of finite 3-dimensional spaces. The project also aims to study the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and in particular understand the simplest such manifolds and how their geometric properties (such as volume) relate to their topological properties, such as how many components of the boundary.",05/13/2008,04/20/2010,,806027,Ian,Agol,ianagol@gmail.com,05/13/2008,,Principal Investigator,University of California-Berkeley,BERKELEY,947101749,5106433891,1608 4TH ST STE 201,United States,California,CA,0000099,Other Applications NEC,1267,TOPOLOGY,"['0000', 'OTHR']","['UNASSIGNED', 'OTHER RESEARCH OR EDUCATION']"

A Lipobead Based Microarray Platform for the Label-Free Detection of Bacterial Exotoxins,07/01/2008,06/30/2011,174595,Continuing Grant,7020000,Directorate For Engineering,"Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys",Robert M. Wellek,"CBET-0829052&lt;br/&gt;Maldarelli&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a ultra-miniaturized microarray platform for the detection of bacterial exotoxins. Bacterial exotoxins are the primary virulence factors for many human diseases. As they are easily carried through food and water borne pathways, they pose a significant threat to public health, especially in underdeveloped countries where food and water sources are not secure. Their use as an instrument of bioterrorism cannot be overlooked. The first line of defense against these pathogens is a rapid detection, but this has become more difficult over the past several years as the number of pathogens has proliferated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The microarray platform used in this project specifically addresses the needs for detection systems which are rapid and can identify a toxin from among hundreds of possibilities. The microarray displays an assembly of capture molecules, each of which selectively binds to a different toxin. The capture molecules used by the array are the natural membrane receptors which the exotoxins use to target and attach to cells before infecting them. As such, these receptors bind the toxins with high selectivity and affinity. The receptors are displayed in the array by first sequestering them in supported&lt;br/&gt;phospholipids bilayers which are formed around polystyrene particles of the order of ten microns in size. Batches of lipobeads are prepared separately, with each batch displaying a single receptor whose identity is encoded by a spectral barcode composed of the emission spectrum of luminescent nanocrystals (quantum dots or Qds)encapsulated in the bead. Lipobeads, each with a different receptor and identifying barcode, are then arrayed on a surface by attaching them to microwells pre-patterned on the surface. This research will develop a fluorescence detection system for identifying the binding of a toxin to a particular capture molecule in the array without having tolabel the toxin or perform subsequent assays on the bound toxin. The label free system is based on measuring the changes in the resonance energy transfer between donor and acceptor fluorescence pairs pre-labeled in the bilayer. This as is assaying will allow a much shorter screening time compared to present approaches which usually require further analytical steps. The miniaturized design also allows for the display of receptors at different concentrations in the bilayers which will allows the binding affinity to be measured. This additional information allows toxins to be identified with greater accuracy, particularly in the case where two bind to the same receptor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultra-miniaturized, label-free microarray for toxin detection developed in this proposal allows for the rapid screening of analyte samples for the detection of a particular toxin from a potential list of hundreds. The design can be adopted to the general display of membrane receptors for understanding binding interactions in drug discovery, and the lipobeads used as array elements can alo be used in flow cytometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will support two graduate students and undergraduates, each of which will be educated in interfacial and biological sciences. Their research will also be in collaboration with the Soft Material IGERT Program in the Department of Chemical Engineering at City College whose focus it is to educate students in the various disciplines of soft matter physics.",07/09/2008,08/06/2009,,829052,"['Charles', 'Alexander', 'M Lane']","['Maldarelli', 'Couzis', 'Gilchrist']","['cmaldarelli@ccny.cuny.edu', 'acouzis@ccny.cuny.edu', 'gilchrist@ccny.cuny.edu']","['07/09/2008', '07/09/2008', '07/09/2008']","[None, None, None]","['Principal Investigator', 'Co-Principal Investigator', 'Co-Principal Investigator']",CUNY City College,NEW YORK,100319101,2126505418,160 CONVENT AVE,United States,New York,NY,0308000,Industrial Technology,1414,INTERFAC PROCESSES & THERMODYN,"['0000', '051E', 'OTHR']","['UNASSIGNED', 'Interfacial trans & thermodynamic', 'OTHER RESEARCH OR EDUCATION']"
Regression-based Quality Improvement in Complex Systems with Consideration of Data Uncertaintly,09/01/2008,08/31/2013,190476,Standard Grant,7030000,Directorate For Engineering,"Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn",Edwin Romeijn,"The objective of this research project is to develop new regression-based methods for quality improvement in data-rich complex systems by considering various types of data uncertainties. This is motivated by the fact that many existing statistical and data mining methods for process monitoring, abnormality detection, and fault diagnosis have limited capabilities in handling data uncertainties, making them less effective when applied to real-world applications. On the other hand, research on data uncertainties has mainly been conducted from a pure statistics point of view, without linking the modeling and analysis of data uncertainties to quality improvement objectives. To overcome these limitations, four inter-related research tasks will be performed in this project, including (1) process modeling, monitoring, and fault detection based on data with uncertainties; (2) separation of process fault and sensor fault; (3) optimal sensor allocation for fulfilling prescribed requirements on monitoring and diagnosis capabilities; (4) identification of the maximum allowable level of data uncertainty under prescribed requirements on monitoring and diagnosis capabilities. This research will be demonstrated in a multistage complex manufacturing process as well as in Alzheimer?s disease study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will (1) bridge the gap between data uncertainty studies&lt;br/&gt;in theoretical statistics and traditional quality engineering research that generally overlooked data uncertainties in developing quality improvement methodologies; (2) advance the state-of-art of the research in quality improvement by providing new enabling methodologies that facilitate process monitoring, detection, diagnosis, and control based on data with various types of uncertainties; (3) guide the design, selection, and allocation of sensors, as well as the data collection process, to guarantee that data uncertainties will not interfere with achieving quality improvement objectives. The research agenda will be integrated with an education plan, including new curriculum development, student internship opportunities, women and minority student recruitment, and K-12 programs. &lt;br/&gt;",07/11/2008,01/28/2009,,825827,Jing,Li,jli3175@gatech.edu,07/11/2008,,Principal Investigator,Arizona State University,TEMPE,852813670,4809655479,660 S MILL AVENUE STE 204,United States,Arizona,AZ,0308000,Industrial Technology,1786,MANFG ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS,"['071E', '1786', '9102', '9146', '9147', '9148', '9178', '9251', 'MANU']","['MFG ENTERPRISE OPERATIONS', 'MANFG ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS', 'WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC', 'MANUFACTURING BASE RESEARCH', 'GENERIC TECHNOL FOR MANUFACTURING CELLS', 'TOOLS & TECHNOL FOR MANUFACTURING DESIGN', 'UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION', 'REU SUPP-Res Exp for Ugrd Supp', 'MANUFACTURING']"
Collaborative Research: Efficient High Order Methods for Deterministic and Stochastic Problems in Flow Analysis and Control,08/01/2008,07/31/2012,54941,Standard Grant,3040000,Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien,Division Of Mathematical Sciences,Junping Wang,"Efficient, high order, spectral element algorithms will be developed to   analyze and control large-scale deterministic and stochastic problems in unsteady compressible fluid flow. The focus will be on spatial, temporal, polynomial chaos, and adjoint based optimal control algorithms that can be used for active control of complex time-dependent flows, particularly those that include the generation and propagation of aerodynamic noise. For the time and space approximations, we will develop discontinuous Galerkin spatial  &lt;br/&gt;approximations and high order, optimized implicit/explicit (IMEX) methods that minimize phase and dissipation errors.  Adjoint based methods for flow control will be used, and control strategies developed for appropriate use with the discontinuous Galerkin approximation. Since uncertainty is present in real flows, we will include efficient stochastic collocation approximations. Finally, we will allow controls to be deterministic or stochastic, and develop strategies to control flows in the presence of uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The class of problems addressed by these methods are of great practical importance and require very large, computationally intensive simulations with efficient and high order methods. The ability to control acoustic noise generation is important to a wide variety applications, from windmill farms to jet engines.  Problems of optimality under uncertainty occur frequently in a wide variety of problems in science, engineering and technology that have  &lt;br/&gt;probabilistic parameters, nondeterministic initial conditions, uncertain input situations, and models based on incomplete knowledge.  A large number of problems such as engineering design, supply allocation, production planning and scheduling, transportation, inventory networks, finance, energy systems, environmental protection, pattern recognition, and military logistics require that decisions be made in the presence of uncertainty. Uncertainty governs the prices of fuels, the availability of electricity, and the demand for chemicals. Much of life requires us to make optimal choices under uncertainty, i.e., to choose the optimum from some set of optional courses of action in uncertain situations. Clearly, the development of the mathematics and computational methods for optimal control with and without uncertainty has broad impacts both inside and outside mathematics.",07/09/2008,07/09/2008,,810875,Ana-Maria,Croicu,acroicu@kennesaw.edu,07/09/2008,,Principal Investigator,Kennesaw State University Research and Service Foundation,KENNESAW,301445588,4705786381,1000 CHASTAIN RD MAILSTOP 0111,United States,Georgia,GA,0000099,Other Applications NEC,1271,COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS,"['0000', 'OTHR']","['UNASSIGNED', 'OTHER RESEARCH OR EDUCATION']"

The goal of the PETRA08 conference is to bring together experts from diverse domains to address an important social and healthcare issue, namely that as the world's population ages there is an urgent need to develop solutions for in-home care of the elderly, as well as of people with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other disabilities or traumas.  PETRA08 will provide a unique venue that focuses on combining wireless computing, sensors, and other pervasive computing technologies to assistive environments; unlike traditional computer science conferences, it will create a channel for applying basic CS principles to the service of millions of humans in need.  More information about PETRA08 may be found at www.petrae.org; the organizers hope the conference will become an annual event.  The goals of the Doctoral Consortium are to increase the exposure and visibility of the participants' work within the community, to help establish a sense of community among this next generation of researchers, and to help foster their research efforts by providing substantive feedback and guidance from a group of senior researchers in a supportive and interactive environment.  Student participants in the Doctoral Consortium will make formal presentations of their work and will receive feedback from a faculty panel; the feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Doctoral Consortium attendees will have short papers on their work included in the Conference Proceedings, and a summary report on the event will be posted on the conference website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The PETRA08 Doctoral Consortium will bring together some of the best students, researchers and practitioners in relevant fields, and will thereby afford the younger participants a unique opportunity to gain wider exposure for their innovative ideas while also receiving reinforcement for the importance and value of conducting research with societal impact.  The workshop will also allow the junior participants to create a social network both among themselves and with senior colleagues.

Bouldin,"Non-technical Abstract<br/>""Cloud Computing"" is a term that has gained prominence recently to describe the use of a large body of compute resources located at many different locations. These resources are typically owned by third-party organizations and are made available to consumers in terms of the capabilities of each computer rather than the underlying hardware in use. This model proved its success almost immediately in the web services hosting domain, the principle target for most cloud service providers. Our aim here is to determine whether these same resources can be adapted for scientific purposes. Thus we propose to develop applications of cloud computing for scientific calculations and making such calculations feasible for working scientists lacking sufficient compute resources at the present. Modern scientific applications require high-performance computing facilities which are beyond the reach of many practitioners who lack both the experience and funding to complete serious scientific calculations, even though their work might be enhanced by currently feasible calculations.<br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The goal of resource virtualization is to divorce workflow from locality constraints, thereby allowing it to migrate freely amongst available physical resources. This flexibility yields tremendous scheduling advantages, as jobs can be placed and often migrated in order to make the most efficient use of available hardware. Resource virtualization is certainly nothing new. For example, Condor allows a user to access a large pool of compute resources, each one of which may be a completely unique hardware configuration. Condor's virtualization strategy is to ""trick"" the application into thinking that it is on the home machine. The drawback is that Condor must replace system libraries, which are architecture- and OS-specific. Hence, this strategy can be very time consuming to support. Another virtualization strategy uses ?grid computing.? Writing an application that is ""grid-enabled"" means writing an application with the appropriate protocols in place so that it can be moved around by the grid middleware. The disadvantage here is that most scientists do not have the background or the time to write grid-enabled programs.<br/>We argue that within administrative differences between Cloud and Grid computing can be found the potential for CC's most intriguing and useful advantages. For instance, Amazon?s EC2 (""Elastic Compute Cloud"") provides not just another web services platform, but a fully virtual computer. An EC2 ""compute instance"" gives you a comprehensive set of virtual hardware, complete with disk space, RAM, and IP address. On this virtual platform, you then install your own operating system. The compelling aspect of this strategy is that it virtualizes exactly what needs to be and no more: the hardware. Doing so provides the utmost extreme in generality: if I can run an application on the desktop sitting in front of me then I can run it in the Amazon Cloud.<br/>The goal of this work is to test this idea and compare the performance and economy of this Amazon Cloud approach with a traditional computing cluster.",09/16/2008,09/16/2008,,848950,"['John', 'Jeffrey']","['Rehr', 'Gardner']","['jjr@phys.washington.edu', 'gardnerj@phys.washington.edu']","['09/16/2008', '09/16/2008']","[None, None]","['Principal Investigator', 'Co-Principal Investigator']",University of Washington,Seattle,981950001,2065434043,4333 Brooklyn Ave NE,United States,Washington,WA,0106000,Materials Research,1750,MPS DMR INSTRUMENTATION,"['9161', '9237', 'AMPP']","['SINGLE DIVISION/UNIVERSITY', 'SMALL GRANTS-EXPLORATORY RSRCH', 'ADVANCED MATERIALS & PROCESSING PROGRAM']"
Mitochondrial Cell Death Signaling in S Male-Sterile Maize,09/01/2008,08/31/2011,298533,Standard Grant,8090300,Direct For Biological Sciences,Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems,Robert Slocum,"The regulated, or programmed, death of cells is central to normal development, and to disease and defense response, in both plants and animals. Despite the importance of programmed cell death, little is known about this process in plants. This project seeks to identify the molecular and cellular events leading to genetically controlled cell death in maize pollen. A particular gene, part of the maternally inherited mitochondrial genome, is suspected to cause cell death associated with the S-type of pollen sterility in maize. To unequivocally identify the responsible gene, the University of Florida investigators will use genetic transformation to introduce the products of suspect or candidate genes into the mitochondria of normal maize pollen. They expect that the death of the genetically transformed pollen will identify the gene for this pollen sterility trait. To determine whether problems with mitochondrial function precede pollen cell death, these researchers will introduce protective gene products into the mitochondria of S-type pollen. Here, they expect that the rescue of pollen function will confirm links between specific mitochondrial events and programmed cell death in plants. The Bennett College for Women collaborators will use genetic transformation to introduce a highly regulated form of the cell death gene into plant cell cultures, such that cell death events can be induced and studied at will in the laboratory. The broader scientific impacts of this project include new tools and insights to better understand and manipulate cell death pathways for plant improvement. Educational impacts include not only the training of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students at the University of Florida, but also the establishment of a research program involving undergraduates at Bennett College for Women.

Nonlinear Harmonic Techniques for Studies of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes,10/01/2008,09/30/2013,299999,Standard Grant,7020000,Directorate For Engineering,"Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys",Ram Gupta,"CBET-0829171<br/>Adler<br/><br/>Advances in ceramic manufacturing have revitalized interest in the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) as an efficient means to recover electricity from fossil and renewable hydrocarbons, including biomass. Developers have successfully lowered operating temperatures of SOFCs below 600°C, leading to improved reliability and reduced capital cost. One factor leading to these successes has been the use of alternate electrode materials based on mixed-conducting ceramics (materials which carry both oxygen ions and electrons), often called mixed conductors. Although promising, the reason mixed-conductors improve performance remains unclear, and they also suffer from poorly-understood degradation problems. <br/>In order to develop a better understanding of how mixed-conductors work as electrodes, Adler and his coworkers at the University of Washington have been developing a new electrochemical measurement technique called ""nonlinear electrochemical impedance spectroscopy"" (NLEIS).  This technique relies on small (almost immeasurable) harmonic signals generated when an oscillating current is passed through the electrode.  A relevant analogy is music.  The reason you can tell the difference between different instruments playing the same note is that each instrument also generates harmonic and anharmonic tones in conjunction with the primary tone being played. These small extra signals are detected by your ear, and act like a fingerprint for the physical process generating them (vibrating string of a guitar, resonating wooden cavity of a violin, etc).  In the same way NLEIS helps the Adler group figure of what physical of chemical process is limiting or degrading electrode performance. In this renewal, Adler's group will use NLEIS to study an array of materials (SOFC cathodes and anodes) having well-defined microstructure made by pulsed-laser deposition and nanofabrication.  They will also further develop the technique, including methods for improved acquisition and interpretation of NLEIS data.<br/>Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity - The proposed work forms part of a broader effort to better understand high-temperature solid-state electrode reactions, of critical importance to several technologies including solid oxide fuel cells, oxide sensors, and oxygen separation devices. This project involves original and transformative concepts in both experimental techniques and theory/modeling, and will complement more applied projects involving fuel cell electrode development (DOE/SECA), and understanding the electrocatalytic role of 3-D microstructure using FIB-SEM (NSF collaborative research grant with Northwestern University). The principal investigator has 19 years of academic and industrial experience in this field, while the proposing institution is a world leader in electrochemical engineering and electrocatalysis.  The proposed work would also advance a burgeoning international collaboration between the University of Washington and Tohoku University, one of the world's leading institutes for high-temperature electrochemical materials. <br/>Broader Impacts of the Proposed Work - In addition to gaining knowledge of direct interest to SOFC's, this work will develop transformative techniques of general interest in other areas of electrochemical engineering, including membrane fuel cells (of all types), solid-state and thin-film batteries, electrochemical materials processing, electrochemical sensors, coatings and thin films, and other solid-state interfacial devices.

The San Antonio Mathematics and Science Education Partnership (SAMSEP) will bring together all stakeholders from the various demographic groups to establish a strong and comprehensive partnership with a shared vision of addressing local and regional gaps in student achievement in STEM education.  <br/>The long-term goal of the project is to prepare students to succeed in higher education and contribute to workforce needs by creating a regional Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Center at UTSA that will serve as a hub for the coordination of efforts between the city?s fifteen school districts, the five campus community college districts and the other four institutions of higher learning.  <br/>The objectives are to increase student achievement in the sciences, engineering, and mathematics K-16, increase the rigor of STEM courses offered, align curriculum, particularly between high school and first year college, and develop a broad base of support within the civic and business community.  Partners in civic leadership and the business community are a critical addition to the academic group as they can assist in practical training and identifying local job related needs in the expanding manufacturing and high tech industry in San Antonio. <br/> The results of this START project will be incorporated into a needs assessment that will provide a framework for STEM faculty involvement, address the five MSP key features, implement and assess pilot projects and support the development of a follow up Targeted Partnership. The intended project has the potential to positively impact a large number of underserved students in the San Antonio. The proposed activity will serve as a pathway to broadly integrate STEM learning across diverse partner organizations and to provide additional opportunities for collaborative engagement to vertically aligned and/or horizontally aligned K-20 institutions of learning.  A product will be a digital social networking tool that after initially supporting partner interactions will become a resource for others.  <br/>",09/17/2008,09/17/2008,,832031,"['J.

Collaborative Research:  Advanced Analogical Search with Integrated Function and Form: The Verrocchio Project,07/01/2009,06/30/2012,343187,Standard Grant,7030000,Directorate For Engineering,"Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn",Paul Collopy,"The research objective of this award is to improve understanding and capabilities in concept generation through design by analogy methods. The proposed approach, a collaboration between the disciplines of cognitive psychology, engineering design and computer science, is to provide new tools for design based on a representation that associates functional and geometric information, combining a linguistic search for functional similarity with a multi-level search for geometric similarity to automatically identify and present analogies to the designer. The initial application for the Verrocchio Project is the design of prosthetic and orthotic devices for persons with disabilities, a domain that is ripe for innovation. The initial search space is the USPTO utility patent repository.  Deliverables will include: (1) means to more effectively generalize design problems through functional descriptions; (2) the ability to search for analogical solutions with alternative functional representations; (3) ways to search for geometric similarities across a set of functional analogies; and (4) the ability to produce a tractable set of analogies for use by the designer.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will have five broad and transformative impacts. The first impact arises from the key product of the research: a method for systematically and automatically identifying analogies. This tool will have broad applicability across many product domains, and will improve the efficiency of the search for innovative products in those domains. Second, the research will advance the foundation for use of analogies in engineering design methods. Third, because the research will result in a computer implementation of the method, the work will add to the growing cyber infrastructure of the country. Fourth, the interdisciplinary nature of the research ensures cross-fertilization of theory and research techniques in each of the collaborators? disciplines. This interdisciplinarity will enhance the probability of broad adoption of the approach. Fifth, instructional materials will be developed for training students in the approach. These instructional materials will be freely available to instructors at other institutions, encouraging broader adoption of the approach.",02/25/2009,08/11/2010,,855326,Jonathan,Cagan,cagan@cmu.edu,02/25/2009,,Principal Investigator,Carnegie-Mellon University,PITTSBURGH,152133815,4122688746,5000 FORBES AVE,United States,Pennsylvania,PA,0308000,Industrial Technology,"['1464', '7252']","['ESD-Eng & Systems Design', 'Perception, Action & Cognition']","['067E', '068E', '7974', '9148', 'MANU']","['DESIGN TOOLS', 'DESIGN THEORY', 'GRAD RESEARCH SUPPLEMENT', 'TOOLS & TECHNOL FOR MANUFACTURING DESIGN', 'MANUFACTURING']"

The ultimate research objective is to determine the response of pollination and pollen limitation of plant reproduction to increasing diversity across a wide range of plant community diversities, and determine whether this relationship differs for endemics.  The work will take advantage of a hotspot of plant diversity in the Baetic Mountain Ranges of southern Spain. The goal of the planning grant is to jointly conduct feasibility studies and to gather the necessary preliminary data that will inform the design and implementation of the crucial experimental tests of hypotheses concerning the mechanisms that underlie global pollen limitation-biodiversity gradients. The project will contribute to the development of two students as members of a global community of scientists.

CAREER: ACOustic Underwater Sensor NETwork (ACOUSNET) -- Multi-Level Adaptations,05/01/2009,05/31/2011,165914,Continuing Grant,5050000,Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr,Division Of Computer and Network Systems,Sajal Das,"Underwater sensor networks have extensive applications ranging from natural ecosystem to security monitoring. The basic task of a sensor network is to facilitate collection of the sensed data. To this end, existing works assume a centralized strategy where the sensed data is immediately forwarded to a central sink from individual sensors. This strategy faces formidable challenges due to the intricacies of underwater acoustic channels. Based on qualitative analyses and quantitative calculations, we introduce the idea of distributed storage and collection for underwater sensor networks. In the ACOustic Underwater Sensor NETwork (ACOUSNET) project, we establish the transforming framework of distributed storage and collection of the sensed data. This transform entails multi-level adaptations to the unique underwater acoustic channels, physical limitations, desirable network features and network heterogeneity. Our foremost objective is to establish distributed data storage and collection mechanisms to optimize the ACOUSNET performance. Due to the very different properties of deep water and shallow water, we also put different emphasis and design requirements on them.  The backbone of our ACOUSNET is a suite of physical and data link layer solutions for efficient data transmission. Compared with existing studies on these issues, our endeavor is unique by taking into account the battery nonlinearity and the network heterogeneity. Sea trials are essential for underwater networks since the ocean is very difficult to emulate due to its vast scale and complexity.

However, this correlation may be specific to Western university-trained students.  Moreover, it may be an artifact of the methodology used to assess patience and cooperativeness or the apparent relationship between patience and cooperativeness may be due to a correlation with a third variable, such as trust.<br/><br/>In this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant research, the co PI will conduct studies to explore the generality and origins of the patience / cooperativeness correlation.
