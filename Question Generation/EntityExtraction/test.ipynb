    "This research project is centered around novel sets of in-situ mechanical loading / synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments aimed at understanding evolving micromechanical states associated with microcrack initiation in multiphase metallic alloys. In these tests, lattice strains will be measured during cyclic loading and a methodology will be developed for attaining strains over a vast expanse of x-ray scattering directions for many different families of lattice planes. These data are crucial to the development of a simulation environment referred to as the Digital Material Through a collaboration with researchers working at the forefront of x-ray detection technology (Professor Sol Gruner's group at Cornell), a unique set of highly time resolved in-situ experiments will be conducted that will have exposures on the order of microseconds. By taking exposures over several cycles out of several thousand cycles, it will be possible to produce lattice strain \"snapshots\" during cyclic loading, which will create a \"real time\" link to the evolving mechanical state on the size scale of a metallic grain - exactly what we need to begin to understand microcrack initiation. The project will begin by examining model iron / copper alloys - ideal for this study due to their mutual insolubility and distinct property differences, but will eventually center on several Aluminum/Beryllium alloys - which are also virtually insoluble. In addition, the attenuation lengths for these materials are much smaller than the Fe/Cu so a thicker specimen - crucial for cyclic experiments - and lower x-ray energies will be possible. The educational goals of this project are based on enabling mechanical engineers to employ their design training within the materials engineering arena. This project will also greatly expand the conventional  experimental repertoire that most engineering students possess. The students working on this project will learn to think of facilities like synchrotron beam lines as a place to conduct standard characterization experiments. The Brush Wellman company and Los Alamos National labs will partner with Cornell in the fabrication of the Al/Be specimens. Alloys at several phase fractions will be produced. The experimental program is one aspect of the material representation system referred to as the Cornell Digital Material. This project will initiate the creation of a Digital Material representation aimed at accelerating the design and implementation of fatigue resistant materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n",

    "This research focuses on children's television and how it can be enhanced with digital technologies.  We envision the convergence between television and computing leading to new types of learning interactions between children and parents around television content.  In particular, we may be able to borrow features from educational reform movements to develop novel, informal learning around television.  For instance, if we can model question-asking and inquiry strategies to parents and children, they may be able to adopt and use them to structure learning conversations in the home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We add a new layer of digital information to the analog television experience, justification structures that explain how and why a television program is intended to facilitate learning.  By providing additional meta-information about the educational intentions of a program, we hope to engage parents and children in critical reflection and inquiry around television content.  The justification structures are digitial design rationales, capturing elements of the production process that would otherwise be hidden from viewers (e.g., historical justifications for the inclusion of content, alternative viewpoints and additional questions that were omitted from the final program).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To develop the justification structures, we will examine how television producers currently design and develop their programming.  As we understand their practices and conceptions of learning, we will define justification structures that make explicit the tacit assumptions underlying their programming decisions.  We will then design and deploy digital television technologies to families in low-income housing projects with the goals of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o Developing a theory of justification that describes the content and rationale behind children's television programming&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o Assessing the impact of justification structures on parent-child interactions and learning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o Rethinking the content of educational television in light of these justification structures\n",

       "      <td>The plant disease, tanspot, caused by the pathogenic fungus, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is a destructive and economically significant disease of wheat, which exhibits characteristics that make it ideally suited for investigating properties of pathogen virulence and plant disease susceptibility. For example, the fungus produces multiple protein toxins each of which is required for its ability to cause disease depending on the genetic makeup of the host. Understanding how these toxins function should provide substantial insight into how pathogens cause disease and how plants become vulnerable to pathogens. This project will evaluate one of these toxins called Ptr ToxA and investigates how and where this protein interacts at the cellular level.  The experimental protocol is highly integrative and incorporates a diversity of approaches including biochemical, cytological, molecular, and genetical analyses designed to identify interacting plant partners. Such partners include host proteins that mediate its uptake, facilitate intracellular transport, and comprise the toxin's site-of-action.  Successful completion of the objectives promises to be transformative not only for its contribution to understanding the basic biology of pathogen virulence and mechanisms that govern host disease susceptibility, but also for understanding processes fundamentally important to plant biology including, receptor biology and function, intracellular protein transport and chloroplast structure and function.  The project will support training and outreach activities in several ways including: the implementation of a workshop in molecular plant-microbe interactions at Heritage University, a nondenominational private, accreted institution of higher education sited on the Yakama Indian Nation Reservation in Toppenish Washington; conducting an eleven-week internship program at Oregon State University hosting select Heritage University students; and direct training experiences in an area with broad implications to the plant sciences for a postdoctoral associate or a research assistant and graduate and undergraduate students.</td>\n",

The \"material\" is really a solid state structure made up of microlenses which can track the angle of the sun by use of optical effects instead of the more cumbersome physical tracking systems used today in conventional concentrating solar power. Preliminary calculations look favorable. The task now is to begin validating the concept, by evaluating and implementing alternative ways of realizing it.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual Merit: From an engineering viewpoint, developing a new family of technology is a fundamental achievement of great merit. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: The primary benefit of this project, if successful, would be to rooftop solar power. Studies of rooftop solar power claim that the roofs in the US could supply about 60% of peak electricity demand, and about 25% of total 24-hour demand, assuming today?s 10-15% efficient solar cells. Multilayer or \"tandem\" solar cells have gotten to efficiencies in the 35-50% range, but are expensive to make and to install over large areas. Flexible thin film solar cells are much more affordable a key factor driving their deployment in the market but are struggling to get to 10% in the future. If this new type of technology leads to flexible, affordable easily-deployed sheets which double the electricity one can get from rooftops, the benefits could be enormous. At best, it could let us meet half the nation?s needs in a carbon-free manner, at a price that would support its actual deployment. Considerable R&amp;amp;D will be needed to evaluate this important but risky hope.</td>\n",

This is a large multi-wavelength project to understand the distribution of sizes, albedos, colors, shapes, and rotations of the current comet population in the Solar System, to investigate how comets have changed in the 4.6 billion years since their formation.  This is important, because comets are used to probe the thermo-physical conditions of the proto-planetary disk that led to the formation of the solar system.  Although this is a larger question than this survey can answer, SEPPCoN will address aspects related to the make-up of the nuclei themselves, including bulk strength, mass loss, fragmentation, albedos, colors, and axial ratios.  Good understanding requires observing a significant sample of the comet population, and this project starts by focusing on Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) with an initial sample of 100 JFC nuclei.  This is about 30% of the total known sample and is large enough for statistical rigor.  The study uses data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and from ground-based facilities on Mauna Kea, La Silla, La Palma, and Palomar.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project employs undergraduates for the acquisition, reduction, and presentation of some of the datasets, providing them with a true research experience.  Data from this project provide useful context for upper-level undergraduate courses on astronomical techniques.  SEPPCoN is an international collaboration among researchers in France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and four U.S. states.</td>\n",

       "0  The plant disease, tanspot, caused by the pathogenic fungus, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is a destructive and economically significant disease of wheat, which exhibits characteristics that make it ideally suited for investigating properties of pathogen virulence and plant disease susceptibility. For example, the fungus produces multiple protein toxins each of which is required for its ability to cause disease depending on the genetic makeup of the host. Understanding how these toxins function should provide substantial insight into how pathogens cause disease and how plants become vulnerable to pathogens. This project will evaluate one of these toxins called Ptr ToxA and investigates how and where this protein interacts at the cellular level.  The experimental protocol is highly integrative and incorporates a diversity of approaches including biochemical, cytological, molecular, and genetical analyses designed to identify interacting plant partners. Such partners include host proteins that mediate its uptake, facilitate intracellular transport, and comprise the toxin's site-of-action.  Successful completion of the objectives promises to be transformative not only for its contribution to understanding the basic biology of pathogen virulence and mechanisms that govern host disease susceptibility, but also for understanding processes fundamentally important to plant biology including, receptor biology and function, intracellular protein transport and chloroplast structure and function.  The project will support training and outreach activities in several ways including: the implementation of a workshop in molecular plant-microbe interactions at Heritage University, a nondenominational private, accreted institution of higher education sited on the Yakama Indian Nation Reservation in Toppenish Washington; conducting an eleven-week internship program at Oregon State University hosting select Heritage University students; and direct training experiences in an area with broad implications to the plant sciences for a postdoctoral associate or a research assistant and graduate and undergraduate students.   \n",

The \"material\" is really a solid state structure made up of microlenses which can track the angle of the sun by use of optical effects instead of the more cumbersome physical tracking systems used today in conventional concentrating solar power. Preliminary calculations look favorable. The task now is to begin validating the concept, by evaluating and implementing alternative ways of realizing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: From an engineering viewpoint, developing a new family of technology is a fundamental achievement of great merit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The primary benefit of this project, if successful, would be to rooftop solar power. Studies of rooftop solar power claim that the roofs in the US could supply about 60% of peak electricity demand, and about 25% of total 24-hour demand, assuming today?s 10-15% efficient solar cells. Multilayer or \"tandem\" solar cells have gotten to efficiencies in the 35-50% range, but are expensive to make and to install over large areas. Flexible thin film solar cells are much more affordable a key factor driving their deployment in the market but are struggling to get to 10% in the future. If this new type of technology leads to flexible, affordable easily-deployed sheets which double the electricity one can get from rooftops, the benefits could be enormous. At best, it could let us meet half the nation?s needs in a carbon-free manner, at a price that would support its actual deployment. Considerable R&amp;D will be needed to evaluate this important but risky hope.   \n",

This is a large multi-wavelength project to understand the distribution of sizes, albedos, colors, shapes, and rotations of the current comet population in the Solar System, to investigate how comets have changed in the 4.6 billion years since their formation.  This is important, because comets are used to probe the thermo-physical conditions of the proto-planetary disk that led to the formation of the solar system.  Although this is a larger question than this survey can answer, SEPPCoN will address aspects related to the make-up of the nuclei themselves, including bulk strength, mass loss, fragmentation, albedos, colors, and axial ratios.  Good understanding requires observing a significant sample of the comet population, and this project starts by focusing on Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) with an initial sample of 100 JFC nuclei.  This is about 30% of the total known sample and is large enough for statistical rigor.  The study uses data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and from ground-based facilities on Mauna Kea, La Silla, La Palma, and Palomar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project employs undergraduates for the acquisition, reduction, and presentation of some of the datasets, providing them with a true research experience.  Data from this project provide useful context for upper-level undergraduate courses on astronomical techniques.  SEPPCoN is an international collaboration among researchers in France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and four U.S. states.   \n",

      "The research objective of this award is to improve understanding and capabilities in concept generation through design by analogy methods. The proposed approach, a collaboration between the disciplines of cognitive psychology, engineering design and computer science, is to provide new tools for design based on a representation that associates functional and geometric information, combining a linguistic search for functional similarity with a multi-level search for geometric similarity to automatically identify and present analogies to the designer. The initial application for the Verrocchio Project is the design of prosthetic and orthotic devices for persons with disabilities, a domain that is ripe for innovation. The initial search space is the USPTO utility patent repository.  Deliverables will include: (1) means to more effectively generalize design problems through functional descriptions; (2) the ability to search for analogical solutions with alternative functional representations; (3) ways to search for geometric similarities across a set of functional analogies; and (4) the ability to produce a tractable set of analogies for use by the designer.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will have five broad and transformative impacts. The first impact arises from the key product of the research: a method for systematically and automatically identifying analogies. This tool will have broad applicability across many product domains, and will improve the efficiency of the search for innovative products in those domains. Second, the research will advance the foundation for use of analogies in engineering design methods. Third, because the research will result in a computer implementation of the method, the work will add to the growing cyber infrastructure of the country. Fourth, the interdisciplinary nature of the research ensures cross-fertilization of theory and research techniques in each of the collaborators? disciplines. This interdisciplinarity will enhance the probability of broad adoption of the approach. Fifth, instructional materials will be developed for training students in the approach. These instructional materials will be freely available to instructors at other institutions, encouraging broader adoption of the approach.\n"

    "Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0300055&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Charles I. Steinhorn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project funds travel awards to graduate students in logic to&lt;br/&gt;support their participation in the Annual Meetings and the&lt;br/&gt;European Summer Meetings (Logic Colloquia) of the Association for&lt;br/&gt;Symbolic Logic. These two events are arguably the most important&lt;br/&gt;meetings in the field of logic; since their inception, they have&lt;br/&gt;been international scientific meetings of the highest standard of&lt;br/&gt;excellence. The Association works to ensure that these meetings&lt;br/&gt;cover logic comprehensively and that they represent the highest&lt;br/&gt;quality work being done in this field. They accordingly have&lt;br/&gt;provided important opportunities for intellectual exchange, thus&lt;br/&gt;acting as a stimulus to advancement of research.  For graduate&lt;br/&gt;students in logic, the opportunity to attend one or both of these&lt;br/&gt;ASL meetings is an indispensible component of serious&lt;br/&gt;participation in the profession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Association for Symbolic Logic is the leading international&lt;br/&gt;professional society for logicians, whose membership includes&lt;br/&gt;researchers in computer science, cognitive science, linguistics,&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, and philosophy. It organizes and sponsors a number&lt;br/&gt;of important meetings. Most prominent among these are its Annual&lt;br/&gt;Meeting, held each year in North America, and its European Summer&lt;br/&gt;Meeting. The Association also has met for many years at the Joint&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics Meetings and with the American Philosophical&lt;br/&gt;Association. Recent sponsored meetings have taken place in Asia,&lt;br/&gt;Australia, Europe, and North and South America. During the last&lt;br/&gt;few years, the Association has actively sought to increase the&lt;br/&gt;range and number of meetings of which it is a sponsor. A&lt;br/&gt;particular aim of this effort is to embrace new and emerging&lt;br/&gt;fields in which logic has come to play an important role,&lt;br/&gt;including computer science, linguistics, and cognitive&lt;br/&gt;science. This project will permit the continuation of a&lt;br/&gt;successful program of graduate student travel awards that the&lt;br/&gt;Association has administered since 1993 and that has been partly&lt;br/&gt;funded by NSF since 1997. The program has proved to be a highly&lt;br/&gt;effective means of bringing students in logic to important&lt;br/&gt;professional meetings at which they can meet and exchange ideas&lt;br/&gt;with leading logicians, an experience which is a vital component&lt;br/&gt;in training future Ph.D.'s in the field. Almost fifty percent of&lt;br/&gt;the awards funded by N.S.F. during the period 1998-2001 (the&lt;br/&gt;first N.S.F.-supported awards were made in 1998) went to students&lt;br/&gt;who subsequently have earned their Ph.D.'s in logic. Further&lt;br/&gt;information on the Association may be found on its web site:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.aslonline.org.&lt;br/&gt;\n",

    "This award provides travel and logistical support for the first major workshop on financial engineering to grow out of NSF's recent ventures into engineering the service sectors.  The meeting involves 40-50 participants and takes place March 5-7, 2003 at the University of Florida in Gainesville.  Workshop participants will discuss all topics on which DMII's Service Engineering Program is beginning to provide support, including portfolio optimization, risk management, and modeling of financial derivatives.  The workshop will offer both a mini-symposium on recent developments and an effort to set the agenda for future research.  Beyond NSF, support will also come from the University and from companies interested in financial engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Financial institutions are among the most rapidly growing part of the service sector of the economy.  The associated modeling and analysis activity, known collectively as \"financial engineering,\" is a growing area of research which is highly mathematical and well suited to the skills and backgrounds of the operations research community. This workshop has the potential to cement that relationship by assembling all the interested communities for the first time under NSF auspices. &lt;br/&gt;\n",

The workshop has the objectives of 1) providing undergraduate women with exposure to computing research, 2) establishing and nurturing multi-institution and interdisciplinary research collaborations, 3) strengthening one's decision making power and coping ability with regard to the job and 4) providing support for teaching, advising, and service components of an academic career. The project incorporates a special keynote dinner with an inspirational woman speaker and opportunities to form and nurture relationships with potential mentors and colleagues.  These workshops have been very successful in the past and this project will continue with similar results.&lt;br/&gt;\n",
