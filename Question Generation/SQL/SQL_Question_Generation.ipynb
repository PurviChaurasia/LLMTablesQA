    "            #### Key Instructions for LIKE Queries:\n",
    "            1. Analyze the sample data and schema to identify recurring patterns or terms. The following are **high-priority patterns**:\n",
    "            - Team names from the `summary` column (e.g., \"Boston Celtics\", \"Los Angeles Lakers\", etc.).\n",
    "            - Common terms in the `stadium` column, such as \"Centre\" or \"Arena\".\n",
    "            - IT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON CREATING QUERIES WITH TEAM NAMES\n",
    "\n",
    "            2. Always generate queries that:\n",
    "            - Return meaningful results from the table (e.g., using conditions like WHERE and HAVING with aggregations).\n",
    "            - Use diverse LIKE patterns based on real data patterns (team names, keywords, locations, etc.).\n",
    "            - Include conditions such as AND, OR, and NOT for more logical complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "            3. Add additional clauses like HAVING, DISTINCT, and LIMIT to make the queries more diverse and realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "            4. Ensure all queries adhere to the template provided:\n",
    "            - Use a single result column or aggregation function.\n",
    "            - Use deterministic conditions (e.g., COUNT, SUM, MAX, etc.).\n",
    "            - Ensure a meaningful ORDER BY clause for any LIMIT statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "            #### Example Queries:\n",
    "            - \"SELECT state, SUM(attendance) FROM sportset_2 WHERE stadium LIKE '%Center%' GROUP BY state HAVING SUM(attendance) > 30000\"\n",
    "            - \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [table] WHERE summary LIKE '%Boston Celtics%' AND month = 'February'\"\n",
    "            - \"SELECT stadium, MAX(capacity) FROM [table] WHERE stadium LIKE '%Arena%'\"\n",
